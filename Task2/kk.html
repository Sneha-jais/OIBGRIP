                    Music creates the nostalgia, the memory of joy, pain and express emotions. When it really comes to
                    music and nostalgia, the first name that comes in everyone's mind is none other than our beloved
                    Krishna Kumar Kunnath, formerly known as KK, the most lovable, innocent soul we lost in near past.


                    I am really fond of music and whenever I listen the songs of singer KK I feel like he wrapped a
                    storm in melody. The lyrics,music and his voice is just amazing!!!&#10084;

                <h2>Early Life</h2>

                sang

                <h2>
                    Career
                </h2>

                KK believed that it was unimportant for a singer's face to be seen, but "a singer must be heard".In a
                2019 interview, he said that he felt comfortable with a microphone but awkward in front of a camera. KK
                valued and "fiercely" protected his privacy.

                He did not want his singing to be associated with a particular actor and preferred singing for a number
                of actors. <br>
                In 1999, Sony Music had been launched in India and wanted to introduce a new artiste. KK was selected,
                and released his debut solo album: Pal.KK received the 1999 Screen Award for Best Singer-Male
                (non-film music) for the album.

                <h2>
                    Death
                </h2>

                On 31 May 2022, KK performed a concert at a college festival at Nazrul Mancha in South Kolkata.
                After the concert, he returned to his hotel in Esplanade. KK complained of feeling unwell on the way
                back to his hotel, where he experienced cardiac arrest. He collapsed, and efforts to revive him at the
                hotel were unsuccessful.KK was rushed to Calcutta Medical Research Institute (CMRI) at about 10:30
                pm, where he was declared dead.He was 53 years old.
                <br>
                His autopsy was videographed; the report cited myocardial infarction (heart attack) as the probable
                cause of death, ruling out foul play. According to the doctor who conducted the autopsy, KK could
                have survived if he had received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) immediately after losing
                consciousness.
                <br>
                KK was given a gun salute by the West Bengal government at Rabindra Sadan in Kolkata.West Bengal
                chief minister Mamata Banerjee was present for the salute; film- and music-industry figures and
                politicians, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, offered their condolences.
